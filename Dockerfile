# Multi-stage build for user-management-ui
#
# Stage 1: Node.js builder — install deps, build Vite SPA
# Stage 2: Nginx runtime — serve static dist/ (lean; no node/npm in production)
#
# Quality gates (typecheck + lint + vitest) run in cloudbuild.yaml BEFORE this build.
# The Dockerfile is intentionally QG-free to keep the runtime image lean.
